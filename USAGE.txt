Put the two python scripts in the same folder
---
In the first script : 'run_streamlit' -> Change BASE_DIR relative path to match the path on your computer
In the second script : 'script_py' -> Change BASE_DIR with the same path 
---
You must run the first script 'run_streamlit' to launch user interface.
'script_py' is the main script that scrap, format, save data and have the code readable by streamlit and DO NOT have to be run (the first script will run it). 
---
! Both script must stay in the same folder! 
The code create csv and xlsx files  in this same folder. 
They can be deleted afterward (they are overwritten by the new ones if you rerun the code).
